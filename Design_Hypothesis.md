**Design hypothesis**

Through this prototype, I could get more familiar with the Unity environment. 
I could apply some of the skills that I have learned so far. Creating various materials, 3D objects, and prefabs, 
I tried to see what Unity can provide its users with through these tools. In this prototype, 
I answered the following question:
How to design a simple playable game with various levels of difficulty using my current knowledge?

**List of questions for playtesters**

- How did you find the game subject?
- How well could I employ my skills to construct the game environment?
- What was the game difficulty level?
- Do you think I could expand this prototype idea and go further?
- What other barriers or stuff did you expect to come across?
- What did you find annoying?
- Did you find anything creative in this prototype? If so, what was it?
- What part of this prototype could get done differently?
- How many times did you play the game to get to the village?
