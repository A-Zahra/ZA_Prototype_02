**Design hypothesis**

In my second prototype, I explored how simply creating a dynamic environment using only the object rotation tool. My previous prototype had an adventurous spirit. But, this prototype is role-based. The player should try to collect as many donuts and radishes as possible. Also, he/she should reach the central cylinder.

**List of questions for playtesters**

- How did you find the game difficulty level?
- Could you collect any of the radishes?
- Did you like the game?
- Do you have any suggestions?
- What did you find annoying?
- How was the arches' rotation speed? Did you find the rotation speed too fast?
- How many times did you play the game?
- Do you think this game could be more fun with background music?

**Reflection on playtests**
