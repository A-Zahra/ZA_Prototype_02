**Design hypothesis**

In my second prototype, I explored how simply creating a dynamic environment using only the object rotation tool. My previous prototype had an adventurous spirit. But, this prototype is role-based. The player should try to collect as many donuts and radishes as possible. Also, he/she should reach the central cylinder.

**List of questions for playtesters**

- How did you find the game difficulty level?
- Could you collect any of the radishes?
- Did you like the game?
- Do you have any suggestions?
- What did you find annoying?
- How was the arches' rotation speed? Did you find the rotation speed too fast?
- How many times did you play the game?
- Do you think this game could be more fun with background music?

**Reflection on playtests**

  This prototype was an unfinished version of a game that I intended to make as my second prototype. In the game, the player was supposed to collect a bunch of collectible foods and fruits as they jumped and walked on the arches. The main goal of the game was to reach the central column. A simple light show was supposed to get displayed as the winner's prize. Due to time constraints and my limited skills in Unity, I couldn't get to that point. 
  But, I found the playtest feedback very helpful even with this level of my game progression. I realized the game environment has been engaging. Almost all players believed that I should add obstacles to make the game harder. Some also suggested adding a timer and restart button.
  Moreover, the players could find a set of bugs in my game that personally I didn't realize.
Everyone agreed with adding background music, and some recommended adding sound effects to the game components. And finally, I need to clarify the game concept/goal if I want to use this game as my final project.
